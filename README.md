# AymanSecNotes

This is all my notes gathered in PDF format. This is a work in progress and hopefully will grow more to an awsome repository. Alot of notes here are a result of self study so execuse me for any wrong info just let me know so I can change it. Also I am open to any tips or additions that anybody want to offer.

## Recommendations

* I would say the mobile is the most solid followed by Web , Machines.

## Future plan :

* For every folder I will gather all in one pdf to be a full cheatsheet.
* Add Hyper Links in this readme to be easier to access all from here directly. (Special Thanks to Kawkab <3 for these two Suggestion)
* Networks Notes.
* Methodology.
* Bughunting (Tips , Methodolgy , maybe some writeups).
* More web.
* Change files from PDF to Md format. (tedious so when I have time or if anyone knows a quick way).
* Solve Challenges on other platform other than root-me.
* Make a good push on hackthebox.
* Tryhackme writeups.
* Wifi notes.
* IOS Notes.
* Buffer overflow notes.
* Active Directory and windows (better) notes.
* OWASP testing guide , mobile testing guide, mobile top 10 , code review.

If there is any recommendation, wrong information please contact me at any time.
